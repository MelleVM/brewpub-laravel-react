Beech is drier than alder, reports brewmaster John Maier, so we use a little of that for added complexity. Welkommen, a smoky, nutty ale, is also very dry, which given the 15 pounds of hops (perle and Saaz) added to each 15-barrel batch, is no surprise.\" The seven medals in nine years which Rogue Smoke won at theGreat American Beer Festival in Denver are also a tribute to this unusual brew.\n\n\nRogue Smoke is brewed with Great Western Harrington, Klages, Munich, Hugh Baird Crystal, Carastan (30-37 and 13-17), Chucks Alderwood Smoked Munich and Bamberg Beechwood Smoked malts; plus Perle and Saaz hops. Rogue Smoke is available in the classic 22-ounce seriograph bottle (replacing the older 7 ounce bottle) and on draft.",

Rogues barleywine is described by beer expert Stuart Ramsey as: \"A masterful, intense creation from brewer John Maier....it has achieved a depth and complexity usually associated with well-ages strong ales. I hope the brewery bottles some before it disappears.\" We call it the cognac of beers. An unfiltered and unfined Barleywine. Intense, robust, malty and dark. The cognac of beers. A hugh beer in a little bottle, this is a beer designed for sipping.\n\n\nOld Crustacean is brewed with eight ingredients, Great Western Harrington, Klages, Hugh Baird Carastan and Munich Malts, Chinook and Centennial Hops, free-range coastal water and PacMan yeast. Old Crustacean is best when aged for one year. Old Crustacean is available in a new 750-ml ceramic swingtop bottle (replacing the much older 7-ounce and more recent 12 ounce XS-line package) and on draft.",

Soba has been a longtime staple of Japanese cuisine because of its nutritional value. Buckwheat is high in potassium, phosphorous, vitamin B (50 percent more than wheat) and protein, and its virtually fat-free. The fruits of buckwheat plant are like small beechnuts, which are milled to separate the edible groats from the dark brown hulls. The groats are then roasted and used more or less like a grain (a good example is Kasha).\n\n\nMorimoto Soba Ale is brewed with Roasted Buckwheat, Pale malt, Munich Malt, 13-17 Carastan Malt, and Crystal Hops. (Note, this beer contains Gluten.) The flavor is unique, toasty-nutty sensation with medium body and good hop bitterness. Morimoto Soba Ale is available in a 22 ounce silkscreened bottle and 13.2 gallon sankey kegs.\n\nTo learn more about the Chef, visit Morimotos web page.",

        "descript": "In 1998 the McAleese Brothers, owners of Kells Irish Pubs in Portland, OR, Seattle, WA, and San Francisco, CA, wanted to make an American beer that would float Guinness. \n\n\nGerard and Patrick McAleese asked John Maier to create a beer with a green apple bite flavor profile. It took four batches to get it just right. John used acidulated malts imported from Europe to get the crisp, lemony/apple flavor the McAleese Brothers wanted. The bottle label reflects the McAleese family heritage, puctures the Kells Irish Pub logo, and a traditional Irish flutist. \n\n\nThe first Kells Irish Pub opened in Seattle in October 1983 in Post Alley, above the historic Pike Place Market. The restaurant will remind you of the Old Country with its warm, cozy atmosphere and traditional surroundings. Theres also a patio outside thats a great place to feel the breeze from the Puget Sound and the buzz from the Market. Kells has Seattles largest selection of Single Malt Scotch. \n\n\nThe Kells Irish Pub in Portland is a local landmark and has been named the #1 Irish Entertainment venue in America. Sit by the fire, belly up to the bar, check out the cigar room, and dont miss the St. Patricks Day Festival, the largest Irish Fest in Oregon. \n\n\nThe Pub in San Francisco is next to the historic North Beach neighborhood and reflects the Old World charm and hospitality the McAleese family brought with them from Ireland. \n\n\nKells Irish Lager has won world-wide acclaim by winning 8 medals from the World Beer Championship and a Gold Medal at the Australian International Beer Awards. \n\n\nKells Irish Lager is brewed with 7 ingredients: Great Western Pale, Crystal, Wheat and Acidulated Malts; Sterling Hops; Free Range COastal Water and Czech Pilsner Yeast.",

The Malt Advocate described Youngers Special Bitter as \"rich and flavorful. A triad of caramel maltiness, fruitiness (apricots?), and hop bitterness in aroma and flavor. A fuller malt foundation than some other pale ales, with some background spiciness. Dry, hoppy finish.\" In the SouthWest Brewing News, Feb/March 1994 issue, George Fix wrote \"A strong case could be made for Rogue Ale being included among the top 5 ales brewed in the US.",

Honey imparts a dry, refreshing character to the beer because it ferments almost completely. The honey comes from a beekeeper in Blodgett, a tiny town 20 miles east of Newport.\n\n\nRogues Honey Cream Ale is a light, smooth, medium bodied ale, with a creamy head, hints of honey and a crisp light finish. Brewed with two-row Harrington, Klages and Munich malts and Crystal hops. Discontined for distribution in late 2005, available on tap only at Rogue Ales Public Houses.",
